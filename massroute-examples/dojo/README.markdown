# About

Test drive of the [http://dojotoolkit.org/](dojo) framework in creating a simple client for real-time bus route information from [http://www.eot.state.ma.us/developers/realtime/](MassDOT).

# Requirements

During development, dojo respources where located locally in /js/lib/dojo-release-1.6.1. This included the dojo library and modules as well as the Dojo Objective Harness (doh) which is required to run the tests.
The resources for dojo have not been commited to this repository as I do not maintain that source. Visit [http://dojotoolkit.org/download/](this link) to download the dojo SDK.
